# Computational Ghost Imaging (CGI)

Comutational Ghost Imaging is 

## 0.5% Nyquist Imaging via Deep Learning (Peer review)

We present a novel framework for computational ghost imaging based on deep learning and pink noise patterns, which substantially decreases the sampling ratio over 10 times than previous sub-Nyquist computational ghost imaging works. Here, the deep neural network, which can learn the sensing model and enhance image reconstruction quality, is trained merely by simulation results. There is no necessity to conduct experiments to get training inputs (non-experimental) and add noise to customize with a real imaging system (noise-free). This one-time trained network can be applied to multiple environments and various situations. To demonstrate the sub-Nyquist level in our achievement, the conventional computational ghost imaging results, imaging results reconstructed using white noise, and pink noise via deep learning are compared in several sampling rates. To indicate its non-experimental and noise-free advantages, a group of results with strong environmental noise is presented. This method has great potentials in various applications that require a low sampling rate, quick reconstruction efficiency, and strong turbulence.
